- Variation: Increase sentence length.
- Goal: Make the task longer (via paraphrasing, synonym expansion, and semantically neutral scaffolding) without changing semantics, intent, tone, register, constraints, entities, or formatting.
- Output language must equal input language.
- Preserve EXACTLY:
  • Placeholders in curly braces
  • Named entities/terms, technical symbols, equations/code, citations/URLs, quoted strings
  • Numbers, units, dates, negations, quantifiers, conditionals, comparisons, logical relations
  • Any embedded format or answering constraints in the task text
  • If the task text includes multiple-choice options, reproduce the options block exactly as given (text, markers/labels, order, punctuation unchanged); apply edits only to the stem/context.
- Techniques (ONLY if semantics remain identical):
  • Insert semantically neutral discourse markers or frame-setters (e.g., “In this task,” “Please note that”) and short adjuncts/parentheticals that do not add facts
  • Replace concise phrases with longer but equivalent expressions; decompress terse wording
  • Expand clauses into fuller constructions (e.g., phrase → clause; active/passive reshaping) when meaning is unchanged
  • Use same-register synonyms that lengthen text naturally
- Do NOT: add examples or external facts; redefine/expand technical terms or acronyms; reorder logical steps; normalize/correct spelling/grammar; alter fixed expressions/idioms.
- Target: noticeably longer (≈+20–50%) when safe; otherwise keep the original length.
- If strict semantic equivalence cannot be maintained, return the original task (and, if options are present, return them unchanged).

  • Any embedded format or answering constraints in the task text
  • If the task text includes multiple-choice options, include the options block exactly as given (text, markers/labels, order, punctuation unchanged); apply edits only to the stem/context.
- Techniques (ONLY if semantics remain identical):
  • Remove discourse fillers and verbosity (“please note that”, “it is important to”)
  • Replace wordy phrases with concise equivalents (“in order to” → “to”)
  • Collapse redundant modifiers/pleonasms; prefer precise, same-register synonyms
  • Convert clause → phrase or passive → active if shorter and meaning unchanged
  • Drop non-essential parentheticals/adjuncts that do not affect truth conditions
- Do NOT: add information/examples; reorder logical steps; normalize/correct spelling/grammar; introduce new acronyms/abbreviations unless already present; alter fixed expressions/idioms.
- Target: noticeably shorter (≈15–30%) when safe; otherwise keep the original length.

- Output language must equal input language.
- Target style:
  • If the task text explicitly specifies a target style/audience (e.g., “[style: academic]” or “Target style: …”), use it.

- Techniques (ONLY if semantics remain identical):
  • Adjust lexicon and phrasing to match the target style (e.g., expand contractions for formal; use contractions for informal; prefer precise domain terms for technical/academic; everyday wording for casual)
  • Reshape sentence structure (e.g., active/passive, clause/phrase) to suit the style without changing scope or logical relations
  • For languages with formal/informal second person, adjust pronouns and verb morphology accordingly
  • Keep length approximately similar (±10–20%) unless minor adjustments are needed for stylistic naturalness

- Techniques (ONLY if semantics remain identical):
  • Splitting: break at natural clause boundaries; maintain original clause order; repeat or clarify referents to avoid ambiguity; adjust punctuation accordingly.
  • Merging: join sentences with appropriate conjunctions/discourse markers; maintain original clause order and logical relations; avoid elision or compression that drops content.
  • Limited insertion of semantically neutral connectives is allowed solely for cohesion; do not add facts or assumptions.

  • Use minimal punctuation/emphasis for politeness; do not introduce uncertainty/optionality
  • Do NOT add structural instructions (e.g., “step by step”, “in bullet points”) unless already present
- Do NOT: add facts/examples; change definitions; strengthen/weaken requirements; introduce uncertainty (“maybe”, “if possible”) unless already present; reorder logical steps; normalize/correct spelling/grammar; alter fixed expressions/idioms.

""",

  • If the task text includes multiple-choice options, reproduce the options block exactly as given (text, markers/labels, order, punctuation unchanged); apply edits only to the stem/context.
- Safety constraints for punctuation changes (ONLY if semantics remain identical):
  • Do NOT change sentence type or force: never swap “.”, “?” or “!” between each other; avoid adding “!” if none is present.
  • Do NOT modify punctuation inside numbers, version strings, times/dates, ranges, measurements, IPs, or identifiers (e.g., “3.14”, “1,000”, “2024-06-01”, “v2.3.1”).
  • Do NOT alter math/operators, code/JSON/YAML/regex, or break URLs/emails/paths.
  • Do NOT change list/outline or option markers (e.g., “A)”, “1.”) or their punctuation.
  • Do NOT change grouping scope: keep parentheses/brackets/quotes balanced and in place; do not move punctuation that affects clause attachment or list boundaries.
- Allowed operations (prefer clause boundaries and end-of-sentence positions):
  • Duplicate an existing punctuation mark (e.g., “,” → “,, ”; “.” at sentence end → “..”).
  • Remove an optional/ornamental punctuation mark *only* when it does not alter clause attachment or list grouping.
  • Insert a superfluous punctuation mark adjacent to an existing one (e.g., after a comma at a clause break: “,;”).
- Magnitude: small—apply at most 1–3 safe edits across the text; if unsure about safety, make fewer changes or none.
- Do NOT add text, change wording, or normalize/correct spelling/grammar.
- If strict semantic equivalence cannot be maintained, return the original task (and, if options are present, return them unchanged).
